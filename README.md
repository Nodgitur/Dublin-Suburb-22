# Dublin-Suburb-22

This is a gRPC project in Distributed Systems, for Dr Athanasios Staikopoulos. 

The project is a smart surveillance/security system for a fictional home in the dublin suburbs, named Dublin Suburb 22. The house has a video doorbell, which is used to verify if the user should be accepted before being allowed inside the house. The video doorbell is verified with the mobile application, which prevents the alarm from sounding. Otherwise, the alarm will sound.
